### DESCRIPTION AND GOALS
Our goal with Barn Owl is to automate a micro-farm using the existing greenhouse outside of the Skirkanich building. Several plants will be cared for automatically in the greenhouse using various sensors (temperature/humidity, lighting, soil moisture) to monitor conditions. Watering intervals, fans, and lighting will be adjusted by our system to provide optimal growing conditions. A front-end interface will be used to monitor the greenhouse and provide manual control. The front-end interface will also allow users to specify which plants are being grown in order to better tailor the conditions to the needs of a certain plant species.
